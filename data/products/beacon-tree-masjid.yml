  The Becontree Heath Islamic Society (Dagenham Central Mosque) is a community
  initiative which seeks to assist the Muslim members of the community and their
  children in helping themselves to deepen their Islamic knowledge, whilst
  serving the needs of our local Muslim community by providing a range of
  holistic and culturally-sensitive services, while holding firmly to our
  Islamic values and heritage. We aim to empower the local Muslim members of our
  community who may feel isolated from mainstream services.
